#OUTCOME
This was a first attempt at developing an IOS app during a hackathon. We learned a lot and wish to return to the project once we have a stronger grasp on IOS development.

##GOAL
Design an IOS app that will allow users to input and store their medication information into our database, using google's firebase. Our algorithm will then access the database and use the user's information to create a medication schedule.

##Accomplished
Created an interactive UI that stored information on firebase.

##TODO
Access the information and create a scedule for the user.
